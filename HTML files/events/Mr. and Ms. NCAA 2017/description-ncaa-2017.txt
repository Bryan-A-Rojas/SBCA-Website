Mr. and Ms. NCAA 2017

Date: September 26, 2017
Location: San Beda College Alabang

Appearing in NCAA's annual pageant, 
Angel Dannah Cardoza (III-BACMS) and Adriel Tan (III-BAIS)
defined the identity of Bedan pride by means of exquisite appeal and wit. 
Despite the pair not being able to place a hook on the coveted titles, 
Cardoza managed to bag a few awards for the team--one of which 
was the 'Best in Formal' wear which featured the crowned representative sashaying in SBCA's signature color across the stage. 
She has also been regarded as Ms. Friendship in another highlight category, 
as well as an awardee of the McDonald's choice
