Noise Barrage!!

Date: March 8, 2017
Location: College of Art and Sciences

Joining the stance of the Catholic Education Association of the Philippines (CEAP), 
‘No to death penalty, extrajudicial killings (EJK),
and mining,’ Bedans from the south unified in a noise barrage
earlier this afternoon. The fire alarm was promptly triggered at 12 nn, 
which signaled the students and administrators to gather in their respective buildings
as they expressed their stand on the current concern. College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Prefect of Activities Ma. Lea Martinez shared her opinion on CEAP’s position stating,
“We’re a Catholic institution; we note and we honor that 
God gave us our life and he’s the only one 
responsible of taking it back.” 
According to one CAS student, 
Stephen Lumyeb (III-BSP), the EJK, for him, 
did not undergo due process as it is not acceptable to kill people just because they use drugs. 
Furthermore, Lumyeb voiced his disapproval towards the death penalty. “[Both the Philippines and the Filipino people] 
are being ostracized not only by the local media or local community but even international [media and] communities,”
said Ryan Sicat Ph.D, vice dean for academic affairs. When asked whether the said noise barrage will be repeated, Sicat was uncertain. 
He then challenged the student leaders from the Integrated Basic Education, CAS, and School of Law departments to initiate further noise barrages with their respective viewpoints on current 
and relevant issues. Words by Marc Juris Le Compte (II-BSA)
